# Arduino Projects

My setup:
- Arduino Uno
- Temperature Humidity Pressure Gas Sensor(BME680)
- TSL2561 Luminosity Sensor
- DS1307 RTC (Real Time Clock)

## Weather Station
My first project with these sensors was to make a [weather station](./weath_station/README.md), save mesures onto a SD card and sleep (to save power) for at least 16 seconds.
